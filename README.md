# AWS VPC Infrastructure with Terraform

This Terraform project provisions a basic AWS infrastructure including:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- A public subnet
- An internet gateway and routing table
- A security group for common ports
- An EC2 instance
- An S3 bucket
- Remote state storage using S3 backend

## ðŸ§¾ Backend Configuration

Terraform state is stored remotely in an S3 bucket:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "myterraforms3bucketcloud"
    key    = "state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-north-1"
  }
}

âœ… Prerequisites
An AWS account
AWS CLI configured (aws configure)
Terraform installed (terraform -v)
IAM permissions to create VPCs, EC2, S3, etc.

ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf          # Main Terraform configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md        # Project documentation

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Make sure the S3 bucket already exists before running terraform init.
Replace the hardcoded AMI ID (ami-09278528675a8d54e) with a valid one if needed.
